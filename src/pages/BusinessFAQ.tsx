    color: "from-violet-500 to-indigo-400",
    faqs: [
      { q: "How long does it really take to get my company up and running?", a: "Realistically, expect a timeline of 1 to 3 months. While the MISA license itself can be issued in days, the subsequent steps — commercial registration, bank account opening, and government file activation — take time." },
      { q: "What are the most common legal structures for foreign companies?", a: "The \"Big Three\" for 2026 are:\n\n• **LLC (Limited Liability Company):** Most popular for startups.\n• **Branch Office:** Perfect for expanding an existing global brand.\n• **Joint Stock Company (JSC):** Better suited for large-scale operations eyeing an IPO." },
      { q: "Is a local Saudi partner still mandatory?", a: "No. This is a common myth. Most sectors now allow 100% foreign ownership, especially under the Entrepreneur and Foreign Investor licenses championed by MISA." },
      { q: "Branch vs. LLC: Which one should I choose?", a: "Think of it this way: An LLC protects your parent company from liability (it's a separate entity). A Branch is legally tied to your parent company, meaning the parent accepts all liability but keeps the branding identical." },
      { q: "Are there any \"no-go\" zones for foreign investors?", a: "Yes, a few rigid sectors remain off-limits, primarily in oil exploration, drilling, and military equipment manufacturing. Almost everything else is open." },
      { q: "What exact documents do I need to open a Branch?", a: "It's a bit paperwork-heavy. You'll need:\n\n• Standard Certificate of Incorporation\n• Memorandum of Association (MoA)\n• Board Resolution authorizing the Saudi branch\n• Last year's Audited Financials\n• Power of Attorney (PoA) for your local consultant\n\n**Note:** All must be Apostilled (or attested by the Saudi Embassy if your country isn't in the Hague Convention)." },
      { q: "What are the main license types I can apply for?", a: "• **Service License:** For consulting, IT, agencies, and regional HQs.\n• **Industrial License:** For manufacturing and factories.\n• **Commercial/Trading License:** For retail, e-commerce, and import/export." },
      { q: "Is the \"Entrepreneur License\" right for me?", a: "If you are a startup with a tech angle or an innovative business model, absolutely. You need a support letter from a MISA-approved incubator or VC, but the fees are significantly subsidized (starting at 2,000 SAR/year)." },
      { q: "Does one license cover everything?", a: "No. Licenses are activity-specific. You cannot open a factory with a Service License, and you can't trade goods with a Consulting License." },
      { q: "Do I need millions in capital to start?", a: "Not anymore. For most LLCs and specifically for the Entrepreneur License, there is no minimum capital requirement. You can literally start with as little as SAR 5,000 on paper." },

    color: "from-amber-500 to-yellow-400",
    faqs: [
      { q: "What exactly constitutes the \"Tax Bill\" for a foreign company?", a: "For 2026, plan for:\n\n• **Corporate income tax:** 20% on net profits (non-oil activities).\n• **VAT:** 15% on sales (if revenue > SAR 375k).\n• **Withholding Tax:** 5% to 20% on payments sent abroad. Consulting/Technical services dropped to 5% in recent updates." },
      { q: "Can I open a bank account before I finish my registration?", a: "No. The bank needs to see your Commercial Registration (CR) and MISA License before they will open an account." },
      { q: "What does the bank need from me?", a: "Prepare a thick folder:\n\n• MISA License & CR\n• Articles of Association (AoA)\n• Passports & Iqamas of owners\n• National Address proof\n• Company Stamp\n\n**Pro Tip:** Some digital-first banks now allow online setup." },
      { q: "Can I send my profits back home?", a: "Yes. There are no restrictions on repatriating capital or profits, provided you have paid your taxes and have a tax clearance certificate." },

    color: "from-emerald-500 to-teal-400",
    faqs: [
      { q: "Do I really need a physical office?", a: "Yes, but with flexibility. MISA requires a physical address for the license. However, for 2026, \"Commercial Service Offices\" (serviced/co-working spaces) are fully legal and cost-effective solutions for startups." },
      { q: "What if I want to just work from home?", a: "You legally need a registered National Address for the company. A virtual office contract with a licensed center is the minimum requirement to satisfy the municipality and MISA." },

    emoji: "👥",
    color: "from-sky-500 to-blue-400",
    faqs: [
      { q: "What is a \"GM Visa\"?", a: "This is the General Manager (GM) Visa. As soon as you get your license, you can apply for this to bring the primary manager to Saudi Arabia immediately." },
      { q: "Can I sponsor my employees?", a: "Yes. Your company acts as the sponsor (Kafeel) for all your foreign employees, allowing them to get their work visas and Iqamas." },
      { q: "What is an \"Iqama\"?", a: "It is the Residency Permit (ID card) for foreign residents. You cannot open a personal bank account, rent a house, or get a SIM card without it." },
      { q: "How fast can I get an Iqama for a new hire?", a: "Once they land in KSA, it typically takes 1 week. They need to pass a medical test, and you need to pay the fees via the Qiwa/Muqeem portals." },
      { q: "What are the costs to hire an expat?", a: "Budget for:\n\n• **Visa Fees:** ~2,000 SAR\n• **Work Permit Fee:** ~9,600 SAR/year\n• **Medical Insurance:** Varies (mandatory)\n• **Iqama Issuance:** ~650 SAR" },
      { q: "What is \"Saudization\" (Nitaqat)?", a: "It is the requirement to hire Saudi nationals. The system classifies your company (Red, Green, Platinum) based on the percentage of Saudis you employ." },
      { q: "Are the rules strictly enforced for startups?", a: "Yes. Updates for 2025/2026 abolished the \"Yellow\" zone — you are either compliant (Green/Platinum) or non-compliant (Red). Red means you cannot renew visas or hire new staff." },
      { q: "What are the new Saudization quotas I should know?", a: "Recent updates raised targets for specific roles:\n\n• **Consulting:** 40%\n• **Engineering:** 30%\n• **Sales/Marketing:** ~60% depending on team size." },
      { q: "What happens if I ignore Saudization?", a: "You will hit a wall. You won't be able to renew your own visa or your employees' visas, effectively halting your business." },

    emoji: "🏥",
    color: "from-rose-500 to-pink-400",
    faqs: [
      { q: "Is medical insurance mandatory?", a: "Yes, for every single non-Saudi employee and their dependents. You cannot issue or renew an Iqama without it." },
      { q: "When do I need to register for VAT?", a: "Mandatory registration kicks in once your annual revenue hits SAR 375,000. If you earn less, it's optional (but often recommended to claim back VAT on expenses)." },
      { q: "Do I need an auditor?", a: "Yes. All foreign-owned companies must submit annual audited financial statements to MISA and the tax authority (ZATCA)." },
      { q: "Can I do E-commerce with my license?", a: "Yes, but your MISA license activity must explicitly list \"E-commerce.\" You will also need to register with Maroof (the e-commerce trust platform)." },

    emoji: "🚀",
    color: "from-orange-500 to-red-400",
    faqs: [
      { q: "How do I protect my brand logo?", a: "Register your trademark with the Saudi Authority for Intellectual Property (SAIP). It protects your brand across the GCC in many cases." },
      { q: "Is it hard to close a business?", a: "It is harder than opening one. Liquidation involves clearing all debts, cancelling visas, obtaining tax clearance, and formally dissolving the entity. It can take 6+ months." },
      { q: "What is the \"Premium Residency\" Entrepreneur Track?", a: "2026 Pro Tip: If your startup attracts SAR 400,000 in investment from an accredited body, you can apply for a 5-year renewable Premium Residency for yourself, bypassing the need for a standard work visa." },
      { q: "What support does the government give for hiring Saudis?", a: "The Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF) helps pay up to 30-50% of a Saudi employee's salary for the first few years to support training and retention." },
      { q: "What happens if I miss a tax filing?", a: "Fines. ZATCA is strict. Penalties range from fixed amounts to percentages of the unpaid tax. Always file on time." },
      { q: "Why is \"National Address\" so important?", a: "It is your digital legal ID for location. You cannot open a bank account, get a license, or receive mail without a registered National Address (Spl.online)." },
      { q: "What are the common pitfalls for new founders?", a: "• Underestimating setup time.\n• Ignoring Saudization until visa renewal time.\n• Not budgeting for government fees (iqama, levies).\n• Trying to cut corners on the \"Audit\" requirement." },
